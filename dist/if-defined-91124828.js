 * Brands a function as a directive factory function so that lit-html will call
 * the function during template rendering, rather than passing as a value.
 *
 * A _directive_ is a function that takes a Part as an argument. It has the
 * signature: `(part: Part) => void`.
 *
 * A directive _factory_ is a function that takes arguments for data and
 * configuration and returns a directive. Users of directive usually refer to
 * the directive factory as the directive. For example, "The repeat directive".
 *
 * Usually a template author will invoke a directive factory in their template
 * with relevant arguments, which will then return a directive function.
 *
 * Here's an example of using the `repeat()` directive factory that takes an
 * array and a function to render an item:
 *
 * ```js
 * html`<ul><${repeat(items, (item) => html`<li>${item}</li>`)}</ul>`
 * ```
 *
 * When `repeat` is invoked, it returns a directive function that closes over
 * `items` and the template function. When the outer template is rendered, the
 * return directive function is called with the Part for the expression.
 * `repeat` then performs it's custom logic to render multiple items.
 *
 * @param f The directive factory function. Must be a function that returns a
 * function of the signature `(part: Part) => void`. The returned function will
 * be called with the part object.
 *
 * @example
 *
 * import {directive, html} from 'lit-html';
 *
 * const immutable = directive((v) => (part) => {
 *   if (part.value !== v) {
 *     part.setValue(v)
 *   }
 * });
